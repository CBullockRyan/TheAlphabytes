    <string name="body_what_is_a_fodmap">Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, or
        FODMAPs, are groups of short-chain carbohydrates that are not well absorbed during digestion (1). They include
        many common foods and ingredients like apples, honey, high fructose corn syrup, lactose, and most beans to name
        a few (2).
    </string>
    <string name="body_what_do_fodmaps_do">FODMAPs are grouped together because of their common traits.\n1. They are
        very
        quickly fermented by bacteria in the gut, this creates gases that result in burping and flatulence.\n2. They
        pass
        through the small intestine mostly unabsorbed.\n3. They are "osmotically-active" molecules, causing them to draw
        excess water into the digestive tract (2).
    </string>
    <string name="body_avoid_fodmaps">Well actually&#8230; most people don\'t need to avoid foods high in FODMAPs at
        all. However, many people with functional gastrointestinal disorders like IBS are more adversely affected by
        FODMAP consumption, and studies have shown significant reduction of symptoms in IBS patients on a low FODMAP
        diet (3).

    <string name="content_what_is_ibs">IBS stands for irritable bowel syndrome. It is characterized by a symptom complex
        of abdominal pain acompannied with abnormal bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation, or both simultaneously
        [1]. It is part of a larger group of gastrointestinal diseases known as functional bowel disorders, or FDB, but
        an exact definition does not yet exist since some of the symptoms present differentiate it from other FDB [1].
    </string>
    <string name="content_common_symptoms">There are many symptoms associated with IBS, including but not limited
        to:\n1. Abdominal cramps, \n2. Bloating, \n3. Flatus, \n4. Diarrhea and \n5. Constipation [2]\nAdditionally,
        these symptoms vary widely in severity, ranging from mild inconvienience to debilitating illness.
