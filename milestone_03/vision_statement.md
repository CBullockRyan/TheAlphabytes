For people suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome who want to conveniently determine if the foods they are choosing to buy or consume will impact them negatively, the IBS Food Inspector website is a web-based application that will allow users to explore foods, both generic and from well-known name brands, and determine whether they are suitable for their diet. Using a proprietary algorithm, foods will be automatically ranked from low to high FODMAP content based on their ingredients, which are checked against a database containing hundreds of ingredients from well-established sources. In addition, registered users will be able to input additional ingredients that they've found to be problematic in their experience. For extra convenience, a mobile android and/or iOS application will also be integrated so that users can scan barcodes in store and get a quick score for foods they're unsure about. Unlike other nutritional databases, our product will specialize in just one dietary need, as opposed to other sites that cast a wide net and provide marginal support for several diets.
